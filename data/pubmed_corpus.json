ICP causes mild to severe pruritus, often resulting in considerable skin excoriations, profound sleep disturbances, and severe anxiety, and yet the aetiology and optimal treatment or management of this condition remains unknown. In this review, we consider the role of viruses in causing or exacerbating ICP and discuss viruses that have been most closely implicated in the disease, including the role of Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C viruses in ICP."
